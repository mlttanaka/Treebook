This is my run through of Treehouse's Rails tutorial with the following changes:

  * Use Rails 4 instead of Rails 3.2
  * Use Zurb Foundation instead of Twitter Bootstrap
  * Tweak the layout to play nicely with Foundation
  * Use Better Errors for, well... better errors.

Oh, and the site is hosted [here] (http://mlttanaka-treebook.herokuapp.com)

Ruby 2.0, Rails 4.0.1
